# __TitleMp3OverWriter__

### What TitleMp3OverWriter was?

TitleMp3OverWriter was a application to change mp3 tags in a bulk way. You shouldn't use this application except if you are looking snippets of code. I used:

* mp3agic (works except you mp3 is 320kbps)
* javamusictag (seems not to work)
* MyID3 (no problems detected)

If you aren't a developer, I highly recommend you to use mp3tags (http://www.mp3tag.de)
